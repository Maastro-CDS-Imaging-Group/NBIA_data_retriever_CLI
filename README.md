## Install Dependencies

Since the scripts are written in [go](https://golang.org), some dependencies need to be installed before running `build.sh`:

```
sudo apt install golang-go

go get -v github.com/voxelbrain/goptions
go get -v github.com/rs/zerolog/log

```

After running `build.sh`, three files (`nbia_cli_linux_amd64`, `nbia_cli_darwin` and `nbia_cli_win64.exe`) are built in the directory. Assuming one wants to run the NBIA command line data retriever on linux, one can go on and simply run `nbia_cli_linux_amd64` with the syntax that follows.

## Known Issues

Known issues:
- The `public.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-download/servlet` use `POST` to transfer data from server to local, the connection may be terminated even before the download is complete. Therefore, **PLEASE** set timeout as huge as possible
- progress bar is a mess when using multiple process
- I do not have a account of NBIA, therefore this program could not handle the restricted data for now.
